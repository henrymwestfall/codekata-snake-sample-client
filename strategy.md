**Feeding**

Move towards the food if we are the closest.
If we are not the closest, move towards
the spawn point of the next food.

**Attacking**

If we are the longest, try to circle the
food (leaving a 1 square opening) to bait
other players and to allow them to kill each
other off.

**Caution**

Never enter a one-way chamber. Chambers like
this have fewer squares than our body.
